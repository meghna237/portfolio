            <p>
                Hi, I'm Meghna Rajesh, a final year Computer Science Engineering student at 
                Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science, with a passion for software development. 
                My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, 
                data structures, algorithms, and software design.</p>
            <p>
                I have hands-on experience with languages such as Python, C, and Java, and I'm 
                well-versed in web development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and frameworks like React and Flutter.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my academic work, I've completed several projects that demonstrate my 
                skills in both software and full-stack development, which you can explore further in the 
                projects section of this portfolio. I am currently interning at Mygate, where I'm expanding 
                my skills and gaining hands-on experience in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities. I'm always 
                eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving field of technology.

            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> A modified version of the classic Minesweeper game developed 
                in Python. After successfully identifying all the mines on the board, the player is challenged 
                with a randomly selected mini-game from four different types: the Wires Game, Cipher Game, Memory 
                Game, and Symbol Game.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technology Used:</strong> Python
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome/Impact:</strong> This project showcases enhanced gameplay mechanics and demonstrates
                proficiency in Python programming and the game design. It integrates multiple game types into a single 
                application, providing a varied and engaging experience for players.

            <h3>Habit Tracker Application</h3><br>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> A Flutter based habit tracker application developed in just 2 days. Users can 
                add daily activities and view their progress on a calendar. The appliaction utilizes ObjectBox for efficient 
                data storage and retrieval.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Flutter, ObjectBox
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome/Impact:</strong> This project was a quick exercise to apply what I learned after spending 5 days 
                with Flutter. It demonstrates my ability to quickly learn and implement new technologies, resulting in a 
                functional mobile app with a simple user interface.

            <h3>Library Management System</h3><br>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> A Python based console application created for my class 12 computer science project.
                It features a menu-driven interface with distinct roles: librarians canmanage books and users, while users can 
                search for books, check availability, and view popular titles. The system uses MySQL for database operations.
